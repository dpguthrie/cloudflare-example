/**
 * Integration test for the worker using wrangler-built output
 *
 * WORKAROUND for node:os issue (https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/7324)
 *
 * This approach works around the node:os/child_process issues by:
 * 1. Building with wrangler first: npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir=.wrangler-test-build
 * 2. Testing the compiled worker (which has all Node.js polyfills baked in)
 * 3. Using vitest.config.workaround.ts which points main to the built file
 *
 * Result: ✅ WORKS! Braintrust Eval function runs successfully in tests.
 *
 * Trade-offs:
 * - Cannot import Braintrust SDK directly in test files
 * - Tests the bundled output, not source code
 * - Less granular than unit tests
 * - Better for integration/E2E testing
 *
 * To run these tests:
 * 1. npm run build:test (or: npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir=.wrangler-test-build)
 * 2. npx vitest run --config vitest.config.workaround.ts src/worker.test.ts

/**
 * Key Insight: This proves that Braintrust works in Cloudflare Workers!
 *
 * Both approaches work:
 * 1. Eval() - High-level declarative approach
 * 2. Logging SDK (init + traced + log) - Lower-level imperative approach
 *
 * The user's production code is correct. The only issue is importing the SDK
 * directly in Vitest tests due to missing Node.js modules in the test environment.
 *
 * Using wrangler's build output for testing gives us the same environment as
 * production, where everything works perfectly.
